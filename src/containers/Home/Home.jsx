        <p>
          You can chose each of them from navigation bar to check them how they
          work.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li> First way is a simple modulo kind of O(n) solution.</li>
          <li>
            In second solution I am using worker to handle the computation and
            considering the large amount of input.
          </li>
          <li>Third way is the algorithmic way.</li>
